# Whatsapp-WPF
Demonstration of a Whatsapp app using WPF/EntityFramework/Web-Api

This project was one of the assignments that I was required to do in college.

In this project I've used:

1- Entity Framework as a tool to create the database entities.

2- WPF( Windows Presentation Foundation ) to create my client side application.
   This included a simple interface to interact between users to send and recieve messages,
   as well as registering new account, adding, removing and editing friends.
   
3- Web-API was the server side that included Controllers, Models and Contracts using HTTPGet method.
